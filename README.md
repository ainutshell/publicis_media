<1> . Problem Statement

Write a Python or Java application that takes any block of text and creates an playlist of Spotify tracks using
the Spotify API which is accessible at: https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/web-api/. You can read the
input in any way you want (command line arguments, run it as a web server and take a query string, etc). Feel
free to use any Python modules or frameworks that are reasonably standard.

The input to the application will be the message, and its output will be a list of Spotify tracks, i.e. if the input
is "if i can't let it go out of my mind", one valid output would be

* http://open.spotify.com/track/6mcu7D7QuABVwUGDwovOEh
* http://open.spotify.com/track/5ZRxxnab9kLUqZPzoelgGP
* http://open.spotify.com/track/3L0bYyI0FHRiD1xZfbZedz

To be clear the output should be a playlist that reads out the original text.
And another thing to think about is that you want to break up the poem into a short playlist. I.e. it's better to
turn "If I can't let it go out of my mind" into

* If I can't
* Let it go
* Out of my mind

than to break it down into

* If
* I can't
* Let
* It
* Go
* Out of
* My mind

We're looking for your ability to come up with a working solution and the efficiency of the solution.
Please create a git repo and share it with me when you are done or close to finish. Feel free to reach out with
any questions.
